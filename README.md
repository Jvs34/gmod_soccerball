# gmod_soccerball

Someone might remember this from the old Toybox, yes I made that and I remade this one as well.
This one is better suited for multiplayer, since it doesn't actually block the player physics , but it can still be kicked around. 
Press use on the ball to pick it up. 
The entity can be found under Spawnmenu > Entities > Fun + Games. 
This entity also works outside of sandbox, the classname is "sent_soccerball" if you want to spawn it in your gamemode.
